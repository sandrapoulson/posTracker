MatLab posTracker programs to track mouse behavior in a chambered behavior box

These programs are used in the Chen Lab at Stanford for tracking mouse behavior in N chambered boxes.
They work with MatLab versions 2010b and 2012b, and with Windows 7. We've found they do not work with
Windows 10.

The original author of these programs is likely a member of a prior lab of one of the Chen Lab members.
